# 005. Addition of structure to form state

## Date: 19 Sep 2023

## Status: Accepted

## Context:

As part of League Operations, a Registration form was required. This was built
specifically for MLS Next 23/24 Season, due to time constraints.

A form structure is fetched via an API using an RTK Query.

When parsing a form, we need to keep a record of the actual structure in order
to correctly evaluate wether a `Forms::Elements::Layouts::Group` can be
conditionally rendered

## Decision:

This has been spiked and will be adopted as part of League Ops

## Consequences:

- A lot of the utility functions should be extensible to other areas where form
  parsing is required
- Additional data is not being loaded into RTK, but stored smartly and easily
  accessible by a key
