# `@kitman/components`

Kitman re-usable UI components. The aim is to have components in this repo match
the components in the
[Kitman Design System](https://www.figma.com/file/GfkGAMUiFVB3oFmRPVg8Ze/%F0%9F%8E%A8-Kitman-Web-Design-System?node-id=1795%3A0).
Components are shared pieces of web UI, with strict inputs, ideally not
containing business logic.
