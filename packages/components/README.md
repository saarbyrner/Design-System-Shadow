# `@kitman/components`

Kitman re-usable UI components. The aim is to have components in this repo match
the components in the
[Kitman Design System](https://www.figma.com/design/7VG51RENiXwPZrSMvQGmkL/MUI-for-Figma-Material-UI-v5.16.0?node-id=11838-7926&m=dev).
Components are shared pieces of web UI, with strict inputs, ideally not
containing business logic.
