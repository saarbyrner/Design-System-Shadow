# FileUploadArea

This components purpose is to act as a wrapper to set up the area that the
FileUploadField would be used/contained in.

An example of this usage is if you want to give it a custom section title, if
you want to give it a custom action for the section (i.e. section removal) or
have a set styling rather than reduplicated in numerous areas.

This component is made as generically as possible for everyone's purpose and
hopefully will be easy to expand upon if additions need to be made to the
FileUpload space, affecting all other areas easily for styling and functional
changes.
