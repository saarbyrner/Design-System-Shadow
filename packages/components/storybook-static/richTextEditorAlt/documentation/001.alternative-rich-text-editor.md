# 001. Alternative rich text editor

## Date: 22 Sep 2023

## Status: Accepted

## Context:

An alternative rich text editor is needed in order to fix an issue that one of
the NFL customers is having when using a dictation software called Dragon
Medical One. When they attempt to dictate directly into the current RTE, the
page breaks.

## Decision:

The short-term plan is to test this alternative RTE and see whether it fixes the
problem above. For this, we will enable it under a FF in the Medical Notes area.

The long-term plan is, depending how the short-term plan goes, to roll it out to
other areas and hopefully remove draft.js as the package itself is deprecated
since Feb 6, 2023.

For the reasons above, the component has been given the temporary name,
richTextEditorAlt, alt for alternative. The intention for this naming is to be
temporary and to be changed to something better once we've determined it's fit
for purpose.
