# Links

Link text must describe the destination or result. Avoid "click here" or generic labels.

## In sentences

Link only the minimal phrase or term that names the destination.

**Do** Learn more about <u>contributing factors</u>
**Don't** <u>Learn more about contributing factors</u>

## Standalone links

Use verb + noun without punctuation unless the link is a question.

**Do** Learn more
**Don't** Learn more.

## Accessibility

Ensure link purpose is clear out of context (screen readers). Avoid consecutive identical links with different targets.
