# Confirmations

Use confirmations for destructive or hard-to-reverse actions.

## Title

Ask a concise verb + noun question or state the action, avoiding articles.

**Do** Delete "Wellness Assessment"?
**Don't** Are you sure you want to delete the "Wellness Assessment"?

## Body content

One line stating consequence if irreversible.

**Do** This can't be undone.
**Don't** Are you sure you want to proceed since this action cannot be reversed?

## Actions

Primary: concise verb (Delete, Save, Accept). Secondary: Cancel. One-word labels acceptable.

**Do** Delete / Cancel
**Don't** Remove / Abort / Back

## Deletion flows

Keep copy minimal; avoid synonyms (Erase, Discard) that fragment consistency.
