# Buttons

Button text must make the result of the action predictable and drive confident decisions.

## Structure

Use strong verbs. Prefer verb + noun where needed for clarity. Avoid filler words and articles. Apply plain language (`Glossary`).

**Do** Add injury
**Don't** Add an injury

Single-word buttons are acceptable for common actions (Save, Cancel, Delete, Close, Done).

## Capitalization

Sentence case: first word capitalized, rest lowercase unless proper noun.

**Do** New session
**Don't** New Session

## Verb clarity

Use consistent verbs per standards (e.g., Create vs Add, Save vs Done). Do not invent synonyms.

## Avoid ambiguity

**Don't** Manage (alone) — too vague for a button label.

## Internationalization

Keep button copy short (1–3 words). Do not concatenate multiple actions into a single button.

## Anti-patterns

- "Click here"
- Two verbs in one label ("Save and close") — split actions if needed
- Ending with punctuation

## Related

- `links`
- `confirmations`
