# Sport terminology

Use domain-specific terms when they improve clarity for target users while remaining understandable to cross-disciplinary roles.

## Choosing terms

- Prefer the term used by practitioners ("roster" for American football).
- Avoid sport slang that may not translate.
- Provide a generic label if the surface is cross-sport.

## Glossary mapping

Maintain a table mapping sport-specific to generic terms (e.g., Roster → Squad/List). Add entries in the Glossary for ambiguous terms.

## Consistency

Do not mix generic and sport-specific terms for the same concept in one view.
