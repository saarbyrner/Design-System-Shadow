# Principles

These principles guide every content decision. Use them as a checklist when drafting or reviewing.

## Golden rules

### Be consistent
Use the same term for the same concept. Avoid synonyms that create cognitive load.

**Do**
- Athlete
- Session

**Don't**
- Player (when referring to an Athlete)
- Workout (when the interface term is Session)

### Be concise
Say only what the user needs to succeed. Remove filler and duplicated concepts.

**Do** Keep headings to a single line.
**Don't** Add trailing context that repeats nearby UI.

### Be clear and predictable
Users should anticipate the result of any action. Button and link text must map directly to outcomes.

### Use plain language
Prefer common, short words. Avoid jargon, internal abbreviations, or idioms that may not translate.

### Guide action
Lead with strong verbs. Use the verb + noun pattern where practical.

### Prioritize user needs
Show the most critical information first. Order lists by decision importance.

### Respect the user
Use neutral, non-patronizing language. Avoid blame in error states.

### Design for localization
Avoid splitting translatable phrases across multiple UI elements. Do not embed full sentences entirely inside links.

## Voice attributes

- Professional, not formal
- Confident, not forceful
- Direct, not abrupt
- Supportive, not chatty

## Tone shifts

Tone adjusts by context:

| Context | Tone | Example |
|---------|------|---------|
| Success | Positive, brief | Data uploaded successfully |
| Neutral task | Direct, instructional | Add injury details |
| Error / warning | Calm, clear | Session failed to save. Try again. |
| Empty state | Encouraging, helpful | Add your first widget to start tracking. |

## Decision checklist

Before shipping copy, confirm:

1. Does every action label mirror its result?
2. Is capitalization sentence case?
3. Are word choices aligned with standards (e.g., Select vs Choose)?
4. Is there any unnecessary directional language?
5. Can it be translated without breaking phrases?

## Anti-patterns

Avoid:

- Placeholder Latin (lorem ipsum)
- "Click here" links
- Redundant permission phrases ("You can")
- Unnecessary politeness ("Please") except in friction surfaces
- Stacked nested parentheses
