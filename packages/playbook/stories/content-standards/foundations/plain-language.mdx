# Plain language

Plain language is not simplified—it is optimized for quick comprehension across diverse audiences.

## Principles

- Short sentences (≤ 20 words)
- Common words over jargon
- Avoid idioms and culturally specific metaphors
- Use headings and bullets for scanning
- Remove redundancy and filler
- Prefer the active voice

## Examples

**Do** Add injury details.

**Don't** You can now go ahead and add the injury details to the record.

## Evaluation

Use readability tools (e.g., Hemingway) aiming for ~Grade 7 (US). Adjust if specialist vocabulary improves accuracy.

## Specialist terms

Include domain-specific terms only when necessary; explain on first use or link to the Glossary.
