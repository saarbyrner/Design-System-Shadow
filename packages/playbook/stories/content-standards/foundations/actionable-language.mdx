# Actionable language

Interface copy should help users decide and act without hesitation.

## Core patterns

- Lead with a strong verb.
- Pair with a clear object when context alone isn’t enough.
- Avoid permissive hedges ("you can").
- Present tasks in logical order, most important first.
- Break complex flows into steps.

## Examples

**Do** Add injury details.
**Don't** You can now add injury details.

**Do** Delete session?
**Don't** Are you sure you want to delete this session?

## Button formula

Use {verb + noun} except for established single-word actions (Save, Cancel, Delete, Close, Done, OK).

## Reducing friction

Remove extraneous context already provided by surrounding UI. Keep each label unique and unambiguous.
