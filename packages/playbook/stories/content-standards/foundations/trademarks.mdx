# Trademarks

Respect third-party brand usage guidelines.

## Brand names

Use official capitalization and spacing (e.g., YouTube, iOS, API). Do not invent abbreviations.

## Symbols

Generally omit ™ and ® in everyday UI copy unless legal requires their presence in a specific view (marketing landing, legal disclosure). If required, place the symbol once per page at first mention.

## Logos & colors

Do not mimic proprietary color or logo treatments inside explanatory UI text. Follow design system tokens.

## Verification

Check vendor brand guidelines before adding new integrations or references.
