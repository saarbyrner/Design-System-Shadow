# Overview

Content is a core part of product design. Clear, consistent language guides users, sets expectations, and builds trust. These content standards provide shared rules and conventions so writers, designers, and engineers can ship interface text that is predictable, inclusive, and actionable.

Key terminology used here is defined in the `Glossary` (active voice, plain language, sentence case, truncation, en dash).

## What this covers

These guidelines focus on:

- Foundational principles (voice, tone, inclusivity, accessibility)
- Language mechanics (grammar, punctuation, capitalization)
- Word choices (select vs choose, save vs done, etc.)
- Component microcopy (buttons, links, confirmations, forms, empty states)
- Interface patterns (date pickers, notifications, onboarding, deletion flows)
- Contribution process (how to propose or update guidelines)

## How to use

1. Start with Principles to understand the voice and tone.
2. Reference Language mechanics and Word choices while writing UI text.
3. Use Component pages for structured microcopy patterns.
4. Apply Pattern guidelines for flows and context-specific surfaces.
5. Link key terms to the Glossary for clarity.
6. Follow the Contribution guide to add or refine content.

## Philosophy

Great product content is:

- Actionable – drives clear decisions
- Predictable – reduces uncertainty
- Human – sounds natural and respectful
- Inclusive – avoids bias, jargon, and exclusion
- Efficient – minimal words, maximum meaning

## Not in scope

These standards do not define marketing copy, long-form help center articles, or legal terms of service. They focus on in-product UI strings and short-form explanatory text.
