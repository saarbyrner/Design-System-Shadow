# Personal pronouns

Pronouns shape tone and clarity. Use them deliberately.

## Addressing the user

Use "you" in instructional, descriptive, and confirmation copy.

**Do** Add your session details.
**Don't** The user can add session details.

Use "I" only in settings or consent flows where the user is affirming a personal choice (e.g., "I agree to the terms").

## Referring to Kitman Labs

Use "we" sparingly to clarify system actions or responsibilities.

**Do** We store your data securely.
**Don't** We think you should add more data.

Avoid repeating the company name inside UI copy unless legal or compliance requires it.

## Neutral constructions

Where possible, omit pronouns entirely for brevity ("Add injury details" vs "You should add injury details").

## Inclusive singular they

Use "they" as a singular, gender-neutral pronoun if referring to an unidentified person.
