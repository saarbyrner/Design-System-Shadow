# Accessibility and inclusivity

Write content that works for users with diverse abilities, backgrounds, and contexts.

## Core principles

- Clarity over cleverness
- Respectful, person-first where appropriate ("athlete with a concussion") unless established identity-first preference exists
- Avoid stereotypes and bias terms
- Ensure semantic clarity for assistive tech

## Screen reader considerations

- Avoid directional cues ("see the button above")
- Provide descriptive labels ("Delete session" not "Delete") when context alone is insufficient
- Use consistent verbs for similar actions

## Color & contrast references

Do not rely on color terms alone ("click the green button"). Use function labels instead.

## Inclusive examples

**Do** Add athlete details.
**Don't** Add normal athlete details.

## Gender & pronouns

Use gender-neutral constructions ("they" as singular) unless referring to a specific known individual.

## Plain language synergy

Inclusive content benefits from plain language—complex phrasing can exclude non-native speakers.
