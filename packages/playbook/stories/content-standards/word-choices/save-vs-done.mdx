# Save vs Done

Use "Save" when changes persist immediately. Use "Done" when the user signals completion and the system applies deferred changes or closes a temporary context (e.g., a picker).

## Save

Apply when the action commits data right away.

**Do** Save settings
**Don't** Done settings

## Done

Apply when finishing a temporary selection workflow.

**Do** Done (date picker)
**Don't** Save (date picker)

## Pairing with Cancel

- Use Cancel with both Save and Done when the user can discard changes.
