# Addresses and places

Standardize address and place formatting for clarity and localization.

## General rules

- Use official names for countries and regions.
- Avoid abbreviations unless standard (UK, USA, EU) or part of postal standards.
- Do not include superfluous punctuation.

## Address lines

Order lines from specific to broad: Street → City → State/Region → Postal code → Country.

**Do** 12 Market Street
Dublin 2
Ireland

**Don't** Ireland, Dublin 2, 12 Market Street

## Capitalization

Capitalize proper nouns (Mount Everest, Pacific Ocean). Use sentence case in labels.

## Localization

Support alternative ordering if locale requires (e.g., postal code before city). Avoid hardcoding formats in copy strings.
