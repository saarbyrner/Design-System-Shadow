# Directional language

Avoid spatial references ("above", "left side", "top-right") in copy.

## Why

- Responsive layouts change positions.
- Screen readers do not convey visual spatial directions effectively.
- Localization may alter reading order.

## Approach

Place related actions adjacent in the UI so directions are unnecessary.

**Do** Select a data source.
**Don't** Select a data source from the list on the left.
