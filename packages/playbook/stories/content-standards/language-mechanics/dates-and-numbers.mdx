# Dates and numbers

Clear numeric and date formats reduce ambiguity across locales.

## Dates

Use full month names (February). If space is constrained, use the three-letter abbreviation (Feb). Avoid numeric-only formats (03/04/20) that vary by locale.

Include the day name in full when space allows in calendar views (Wednesday).

Do not use ordinal indicators ("12th") in dates.

**Do** Wednesday, February 12, 2024
**Don't** Wed, February 12

**Do** February 12, 2024
**Don't** February 12, '24

**Do** Feb 12, 2024
**Don't** 02/12/24

## Date ranges

Use an en dash (`Glossary`) without spaces: February 12–April 3. Do not add ordinal indicators.

## Time

- Use locale-specific format (12-hour vs 24-hour) based on user settings.
- In 12-hour format add a space before am/pm (12:00 pm).
- Use organization time zone by default.
- Time ranges: en dash and include am/pm after both times (11:30 am–1:05 pm).
- Combine date and time with "at" (Feb 12, 2024 at 12:00 pm).

## Time zones

Include only when context differs from organization time. Use three-letter abbreviations: 4:00 pm PST.

## Numbers

Use numerals. Optionally spell numbers below 10 if not critical to meaning. Avoid thousand separators if the UI design omits them; prefer consistent formatting (check with design system tokens). Do not truncate significant digits.

Ranges: use an en dash (3–5 sessions). If preceded by "from", use "to" (from 3 to 5). If preceded by "between", use "and" (between 3 and 5).

## Units of measurement

- Storage sizes: uppercase unit after a space (10 GB).
- Dimensions and weights: lowercase unit after a space (5 kg, 12 cm).
- Use decimals, not fractions (2.5 kg, not 2 1/2 kg).
