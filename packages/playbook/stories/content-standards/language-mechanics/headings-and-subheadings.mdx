# Headings and subheadings

Headings orient users. They should be descriptive, concise, and predictable.

## Principles

- Highlight the most important concept
- Use simple, clear language
- Keep to a single line when possible
- Avoid punctuation (except question marks) and ampersands
- Use sentence case

## Conversational headings

Use articles when a heading needs to read naturally or encourage action (common in empty states).

**Do** Secure your account with two-factor authentication
**Don't** Two-factor authentication

## Microcopy headings (labels & titles)

Omit articles to keep content succinct and actionable.

**Do** Resolve injury
**Don't** Resolve the injury

## Avoid redundancy

Do not repeat context already provided by a parent heading or UI element.
