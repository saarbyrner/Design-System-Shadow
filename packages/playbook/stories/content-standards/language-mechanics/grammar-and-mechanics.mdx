# Grammar and mechanics

Consistent grammar improves clarity and trust. Use these rules to structure sentences and short UI phrases.

## Sentence structure

Prefer active voice (`Glossary`). Avoid starting instructions with permissive phrases ("You can"). Use imperative verbs.

**Do** Add your first widget.
**Don't** You can add widgets now.

## Capitalization

Use sentence case (`Glossary`) for all headings, buttons, labels, and navigation items. Proper nouns (Kitman Labs, RPE) remain capitalized.

## Articles (a, an, the)

Omit articles in microcopy and action labels unless they improve clarity or conversational tone in an empty state.

**Do** Add injury
**Don't** Add an injury

## Contractions

Use contractions (`Glossary`) to sound natural unless in legal or highly formal contexts.

**Do** It's saved.
**Don't** It has been saved.

## Punctuation

Limit punctuation in headings and action labels. Never end a heading with a period. Use question marks only when the heading is a direct question.

## Lists

Use parallel structure. Start each bullet with the same part of speech.

**Do**
- Add graph
- Add injury

**Don't**
- Adding a graph
- Add an injury to the record

## Numbers

Use numerals for all numbers (1, 2, 3) except when starting a sentence; then rewrite to avoid starting with a number.

## Ranges

Use an en dash (`Glossary`) for numeric or time ranges (e.g., 3–5 sessions).

## Truncation

When truncating (`Glossary`), provide a tooltip or detail view to reveal full content.

## Directional language

Avoid references like "above" or "left"; instead keep related actions adjacent in the UI.
