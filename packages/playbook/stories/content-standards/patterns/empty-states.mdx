# Empty states

Provide concise, encouraging copy that explains what the user can do next.

## Principles
- Be specific about the action to take.
- Avoid blaming language.
- Prefer a single sentence; add a second only if it clarifies value.

Use `sentence case` (Glossary) and keep tone encouraging (see `plain-language`).

## Examples
**Do** Add your first athlete to start tracking wellness.
**Don't** You have no athletes.

**Do** Invite teammates to collaborate.
**Don't** You haven't invited anyone yet!
