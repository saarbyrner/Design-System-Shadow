# Forms

Make forms scannable and clear.

## Labels
Use noun or verb phrases that describe the data requested. Avoid full questions.

## Help text
Add only when essential. Keep to a single sentence in sentence case.

Prefer `active voice` (Glossary). Avoid repeating the label.

## Error messages
State the problem and how to fix it. Avoid exclamation points.

**Do** Enter a valid date (DD/MM/YYYY).
**Don't** Invalid date!

**Do** Select a future start date.
**Don't** The date you selected is not valid because it is in the past.
