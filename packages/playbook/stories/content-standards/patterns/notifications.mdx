# Notifications

Keep notification copy brief and actionable.

## Structure
- Lead with result (Saved, Updated, Deleted).
- Offer follow-up action only if high-value.

Keep to fewer than 40 characters where possible; use `truncation` rules if necessary.

## Tone
Neutral for success, calm for errors. Avoid alarmist phrasing.

**Do** Profile updated.
**Don't** Success! Your profile was successfully updated!!!

**Do** Session deleted.
**Don't** The session was deleted successfully.
